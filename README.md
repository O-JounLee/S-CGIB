## 1. Overview

We aim to build a pre-trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) model on molecules without human annotations or prior knowledge. Although various attempts have been proposed to overcome limitations in acquiring labeled molecules, the previous pre-training methods still rely on semantic subgraphs, i.e., functional groups. Only focusing on the functional groups could overlook the graph-level distinctions. The key challenge to build a pre-trained GNN on molecules is how to (1) generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and (2) automatically discover the functional groups without prior knowledge. To solve it, we propose a novel Subgraph-conditioned Graph Information Bottleneck, named S-CGIB, for pre-training GNNs to recognize core subgraphs (graph cores) and significant subgraphs. The main idea is that the graph cores contain compressed and sufficient information that could generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and reconstruct the input graph conditioned on significant subgraphs across molecules under the S-CGIB principle. To discover significant subgraphs without prior knowledge about functional groups, we propose generating a set of functional group candidates, i.e., ego networks, and using an attention-based interaction between the graph core and the candidates. Despite being identified from self-supervised learning, our learned subgraphs match the real-world functional groups. Extensive experiments on molecule datasets across various domains demonstrate the superiority of S-CGIB.

## 2. Reproducibility

### Datasets 

We used publicly available datasets, which are automatically downloaded from Pytorch Geometric.
The datasets are grouped into main domains: Biophysics (mol-HIV, mol-PCBA, and BACE), Physiology (BBBP, Tox21, ToxCast, SIDER, ClinTox, and MUV), Physical Chemistry (ESOL and FreeSolv), Bioinformatics (Mutagenicity, NCI1, and NCI109), Quantum Mechanics (PCQ4Mv2 and QM9).


### Requirements and Environment Setup

The source code was developed in Python 3.8.8. S-CGIB is built using Torch-geometric 2.3.1 and DGL 1.1.0. Please refer to the official websites for installation and setup.
All the requirements are included in the ```environment.yml``` file.

```
# Conda installation

# Install python environment

conda env create -f environment.yml 
```
The source code contains both self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuning processes. 
We also provide our pre-trained model (S-CGIB), named pre_training_v1_GIN_64_5_1.pt, in the folder outputs/. 
"GIN_64_5_1" refers to CGIB was pre-trained with 5-layer GIN encoder and 1-hop subgraphs.

### Self-supervised pre-training

#### Pre-processing the pre-training datasets
```
# Pre-processing the datasets for pre-training, i.e., PCQ4Mv2, QM9, and mol-PCBA.
python exp_pcqm4mv2.py
python exp_qm9.py
python exp_molpcba.py
```
#### pre-training
```
# Use the following command to run the pretrain task, the output will generate the pre-trained files in the folder outputs/.
python exp_pretraining.py --encoder GIN --k_transition 1 --device cuda:0
```

### Hyperparameters

```--adapt_epoches:```Number of epochs for domain adaptation. For example: ```--adapt_epoches 30```.

```--ft_epoches:```Number of epochs for fine-tuning the pre-trained model. For example: ```--ft_epoches 50```.
